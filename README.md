- 👋 Hi, I’m @ansito. Currently I am a postgraduate student.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python language, and I want to make it as my mandatory programming skill.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python from the scratch. I commit to seriously learning it since Jan 2023 and hoping it will be grow and be benefit to people.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on people who loves to learn Python from the scratch, because I believe no age limitation for learning something that we love.
- 📫 You could contact me using email.
